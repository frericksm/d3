 #+TITLE: Using Clojurescript and D3 to create a motion chart
 
* Introduction                                                    
  The  motion charts from the  famous TED-Talk of Hans Gosling [1]  are impressive.
  Brett W. Green implemented a motion  chart  [2]  using D3.js[3]. 
  There  is a good  introduction on how  to  use D3.js [4] from Clojurescript [5].
  I will  try to combine things and build a clojurescript library  for displaying a motion chart.
